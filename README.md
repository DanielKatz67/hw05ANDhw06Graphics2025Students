# Exercise 6
## Controls
- O          |  Toggle orbit camera controls
- ← ↑ → ↓    |	Move ball around court (X/Z axes)
- W / S      |  Increase / decrease shot power (0–100%)
- SPACE      | 	Launch basketball toward hoop
- R          | 	Reset ball to center with default power

## Physics System Implementation
### Gravity & Trajectory
Constant downward acceleration (–9.8 m/s²), resulting in a parabolic flight path.

### Shot Mechanics
Initial velocity is computed from the ball’s position relative to the hoop plus a small upward “arc” boost, then scaled by the current shot power.

### Collision Detection
- Ball–ground: bounce with coefficient of restitution (0.7) until it comes to rest.
- Backboard: reflect Z-velocity upon impact near rim height.
- Rim scoring: detect when the ball passes through the rim plane within a given horizontal radius; award 2 points once per shot.

### Rotation Animation
Spin axis = cross(velocity, up), speed ∝ |velocity|/radius, applied each frame for a realistic rolling effect.

## Additional Features
- 3D bleachers and stadium banner for ambiance
- Canvas‑rendered backboard text (THE FINAL – Shay VS Daniel)
- Court line geometry: center circle, 3‑pt arcs, free‑throw lanes
- On‑screen UI overlay: live score, shot power, attempts, makes, accuracy, control hints, and feedback messages
- Fully decoupled post‑make spin so the ball continues rotating after scoring
